                                <p>Harry Potter has never played a sport while flying on a broomstick. He's never worn a Cloak of Invisibility, befriended a
                                giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their
                                abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny cupboard under the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in ten years.
                                </p><p>But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to a
                                wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but
                                a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter.</p>
